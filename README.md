# The Art of Tea 

## Project Overview 

The Art of Tea is a three-page website where users can immerse themselves in the rich history and culture of tea from China, Japan, and India. Each page delves into the unique traditions, stories, and significance of tea in these regions. The site doesn't just offer factual information but provides a cultural exploration, making it an enriching experience for tea lovers.

The primary job of this website is to educate and engage visitors. It aims to present the rich stories and cultural significance of tea, fostering a deeper appreciation among users. The ultimate goal is to make people contact us for more in-depth information or partnerships.
